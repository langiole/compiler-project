# compiler-project
A composite of the three projects in CS 352. These projects use Lex/Yacc to build a compiler for the MiniJava+ language, which is a subset of Java. The meaning of a MiniJava+ program is given by its meaning as a Java program.

Project 1 implements a parser and lexical analyzer for MiniJava+.
