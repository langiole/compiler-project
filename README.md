# compiler-project
A composite of the three projects in CS 352. These projects use Lex/Yacc to build a compiler for the MiniJava+ language, which is a subset of Java. The meaning of a MiniJava+ program is given by its meaning as a Java program.

Project 1: implements a parser and lexical anlyzer for MiniJava+.

Project 2: implements AST and symbol table as well as AST traversal and symbol table lookup to perform type checking, write AST traversal to perform program implementation.

Project 3: implements code that converts a MiniJava+ program into equivalent ARM assembly code.
