# compiler-project
A composite of the three projects in CS 352. These projects use Lex/Yacc to build a compiler for the MiniJava+ language, which is a subset of Java. The meaning of a MiniJava+ program is given by its meaning as a Java program.

Project 1: implement a parser for MiniJava+.

Project 2: design and implement AST and symbol table, imlement AST traversal and symbol table lookup to perform type checking, write AST traversal to perform program implementation.
